# This is my first python project!

![example1](/misc/example1.gif)

Quick and dirty web-crawler I made after about two weeks since I started to learn Python.
I made it for [this](https://novelfull.com/) website.

Requirements are simple: requests and beautifulsoup4

**How to install:**

```python -m venv venv```

```.\venv\scripts\activate```

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

**How to use:**

1. Start the virtual enviroment if you are using it
2. Type ```python -m app.py``` or ```py app.py```
3. Input the novel ToC url e.g. ```https://novelfull.com/dimensional-sovereign.html```
4. Give it some time...
5. Profit!

Code critique is highly appreciated!
